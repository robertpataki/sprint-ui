# Sprint UI ❯❯❯👟❯❯👟❯

Blazing fast, production ready UI development kit for GOVUK, NHSUK or vanilla projects.

## ❯❯❯ Install

```
$ npm install sprint-ui -g
```

## ❯❯❯ Create a new project

Create a new folder, and in the folder's root call `sprint-ui` to generate the project files.

```
$ mkdir my-sprint-ui-project
$ cd my-sprint-ui-project
$ sprint-ui
```

Once your project is installed, you will get a fully structured, ready to go static website, which you can start developing using

```
$ yarn|npm run dev
```

The projects come with a README.md file, which is a great place to start getting familiar with the setup and how to do things.

## ❯❯❯ Project types

Currently **NHSUK** and **GOVUK** projects can be created with the generator.

A third - vanilla project is coming soon.

## ❯❯❯ Roadmap

- Document everything
- Add tests
- Add Vanilla project templates
- Make the project generation logs pretty
